# Codebook

Codebook for the data set "TidyDataSet.txt" submitted for the project of the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data". The codebook is written based on the information available at website "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#" containing the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" as well as the "README.txt" and "features_info.txt" files contained in the downloaded data set.

## Variable "SubjectID"
The first Variable "SubjectID" contains the subject ID of each of the 30 persons involved in the experiment. Thus, the values of the "SubjectID" is the set {1, 2, ..., 30}.

## Variable "Activity"
The second variable "Activity" contains the activity the subject was doing when the other measurements were taken. The values of the Activity variable is therefore: "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, "SITTING", "STANDING", and "LAYING".

## Remaining variables
As I am unaware of the physics involved in producing the data set, some potentially naive design choices have been made concerning: 1) Choosing the columns involving data on means and standard deviations, and 2) the creation of descriptive variable names. For 1) the design choice have been to only include columns involving "mean()" or "std()" in their name. For 2) the design choice have been to use "tocamel" to get rid of "-", "()" and other illegal name characters.

Note each of these variables has no unit as they all has their values normalized to a real number in the interval [-1,1] (according to the "README.txt" file). Moreover, each of these variables in the tidy data set contain the average of each variable (of the original data set) for each activity and each subject.

Furthermore, note that in the variable names, "BodyAcc" refers to "body acceleration" and "GravityAcc" to gravity acceleration. In general "Acc" refers to data from the "accelerometer" and "Gyro" to data from the gyroscope. The "X", "Y", "Z" refer to the three spatial dimensions. Finally, the prefixed "t" stands for "time domain signals" and the prefixed "f" means that these variables have undergone a Fast Fourier Transform.

The resulting remaining variables included in the tidy data set "TidyDataSet.txt" is thus:
